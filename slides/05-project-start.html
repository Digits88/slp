# Survey Statistics
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Introduction
- There are 105 people in the course
- I spent *many* hours working on the project assignments and setup...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Stats
- Most popular projects:
  - Highest project had 70 people select it as their first choice
  - Next highest project had 28
  - Third highest project had 22
- All 15 projects have 7 people on them
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Choices
- The primary metric was the individual project ratings
- With a few exceptions, almost everybody got a project they rated their highest
  - 85 people (81%) got a project they rated as a 5
  - 9 people (9%) got a project they rated as their highest rating (one 3, rest were 4)
- That left 11 people who did not get a project that matched their highest rating
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Choices
- That left 11 people who did not get a project that matched their highest rating
  - 2 were placed due to group placement preferencs
  - 4 only gave one project as a 5, so the lack of flexibility made it impossible to place them better
  - 1 was placed due to their textual comment
- Thus, there were only 4 people (4%) who did not get as high as they could have
  - I'm very sorry to those four of you!
  - But in all those cases, they ended up on a project they rated as a 4
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Choices
- 85 students (81%) got a project they rated as a 5
- 19 students (18%) got a project they rated as a 4
  - But 8 of those had their highest rating as a 4
- 1 students (1%) got a project they rated as a 3
  - That student rated *all* projects as a 3
- Average assigned project rating: 4.80
- All projects have an average rating between 4.4 and 5.0 (six got a 5.0!)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Platform Preferences
- Exactly three people really wanted Rails
  - And one was more interested in the project than the platform
  - The other two had such disparate preferences that I couldn't place them in a group
- So I expect all the projects to be Django based
- I'm really sorry for those who wanted Rails!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Mortal Enemies
- Nobody got his/her mortal enemies
  - I had to do a *lot* of re-arranging for all of this
  - Average of 2/3 a (valid) mortal enemy per person
    - Although one person listed 5 mortal enemies
    - And about a half-dozen listed mortal enemies are not in this class
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## MySQL knowledge
- Most teams have at least one person with MySQL knowledge of 4 or higher
  - Two don't, but they have multiple people at a 3
- Average MySQL knowledge overall was 2.87
	  </script></section>

	</section>

	  <section data-markdown id="assignments"><script type="text/template">
# Project assignments
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Assignments
- It's a [local file](../../../work/slp/groups/groups.html)
- The other members in your group, as well as their UVa userids, can be found in the PostEm tool
  - You'll meet them shortly
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project tag
- Each project has a *tag* -- a short, single word -- which is the name for the project
  - This was shown after your name in the listing just shown
- This tag can be found in the Collab PostEm tool
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project tag
- This tag is used for:
  - The name of your github repo (http://github/uva-slp/tag)
  - Your team login on the course server
  - The URL; see next slide
  - The basis for the DB name on the server (it's `slp_tag` and `slp_tag_test`)
  - Generally how your project will be referred to
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project tags and URLs
- The server name is the same as for the homeworks
- Django projects will be at http://server/tag
- The URLs for other platforms don't matter this year:
  - ~~Rails projects will be at http://server/tag~~
  - ~~CakePHP projects will be at http://server/~tag (note the tilde ('~') in there)~~
    - ~~But http://server/tag will *redirect* to http://server/~tag~~
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Setting up your project
- When you deploy the basic Django site, please register it via the wsgi-admin utility
  - You can find info for that in the [Django getting started](../docs/django-getting-started.html) document
- Then *email me* (Bloomfield), as I have to complete the installation
  - If you don't do that step, then it will not have the correct URL
  - Please don't wait to the very last minute to do this
  - And don't forget to do it either

# Next Steps
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="itlist"><script type="text/template">
## 2017-2018 Iteration schedule
- All iterations start on a Tuesday and end on a Monday two weeks later; they start tomorrow
- There are 6 iterations in the fall:
  - Sep 19 -> Oct 2, Oct 3 -> 16, Oct 17 -> 30, Oct 31 -> Nov 13, Nov 14 -> 27, Nov 28 -> Dec 11
  - The last half of iteration 6 is during finals week
- There are 8 iterations in the spring:
  - Jan 16 -> 29, Jan 30 -> Feb 12, Feb 13 -> 26, Feb 27 -> Mar 12, Mar 13 -> 26, Mar 27 -> Apr 9, Apr 10 -> 23, Apr 24 -> May 7
  - Iteration 10 has spring break
  - The last half of iteration 14 is during finals week
        </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Phases
- There are 14 iterations this year
- Fall semester: all groups will have three phases in the fall semester: iterations 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6
- Spring semester
  - ~~6 person groups will have 3 phases in the spring: 7-9, 10-11, 12-14~~
  - 7 person groups will have 4 phases in the spring: 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14
- I will remind you of all of this when the time comes
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project leadership roles
- Everybody will be lead for one phase and secretary for another
- Restrictions
  - Nobody can have two leadership roles in the fall
    - Thus, 7 person groups will have one person that has no roles in the fall and both roles in the spring
  - You can not be the lead and secretary for the same iteration
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project leadership roles
- You must decide today who is the lead and secretary for the *entire* year
- You can change this later, subject to the restrictions on the previous slide, by emailing me
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Pick leadership roles
- How you pick is completely up to you
- If you can't decide, then I propose the following:
  - Sort everybody by (formal) first names in *reverse* order, and that is the order of the leads
  - The 4th person in that list is the first secretary, and it cycles through in the same order
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Leads
- The person responsible for submitting reports
  - We will see the custom course management system for submitting them on Wednesday; first report is not due until next week
- Responsible for reserving the rooms, creating the agenda for the meeting, and keeping the meeting on track
- This is an *administrative* role, not an *authoritative* one
- At the start of one's time as project lead, I send them an email summarizing their duties
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Reserving rooms
- You can reserve a Rice Hall conference room in one of three ways:
  - By swinging by Rice 527 (the main CS office)
    - Ask nicely, and tell them you are in CS 4970
  - By emailing cs-office@virginia.edu
    - Ask nicely, and tell them you are in CS 4970
  - Faculty cannot reserve rooms directly anymore (!)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Secretary
- This is the person who will take notes at each meeting
- Each meeting (of all types) MUST have notes!
  - This is how I am going to be able to keep up with all the projects
  - Notes must include who was present
- They will need to be entered into the system that you'll see on Wednesday
- The secretary will rotate through everybody, just like the project lead
  - And the secretary can not be the project lead in the same iteration
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Remember to report time
- Keep track of ALL time you expend for this course
  - Meetings (customer and not), learning the framework, etc.
- The only things you should NOT include are Monday's group meetings in class and Wednesday's lecture
- This is to be reported via the custom course management that you will see on Wednesday
  - Recall that you grade will NEVER depend (one way or the other) on how much time you report
  - But there WILL be a grade penalty if you do *not* enter any time
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Scheduling the first meeting
- The project lead should contact the customer listed in the requirements document
  - <font color="red">But not before I give the go-ahead, as I want to talk to them first!</font>
  - I expect that to be today or tomorrow
- But you should really wait until after Wednesday's lecture to *have* the meeting
- Then arrange an initial meeting
  - A note about travel on the next slide
  - You may not be able to meet this week, due to scheduling issues
- Secretary: remember to take notes!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A note about travel
- It is between you and the customer whether you travel to him/her, or s/he comes to you
  - You can reserve a room in Rice
- However, you are not to travel to a non-Charlottesville
  - The UVa office of Risk Management has deemed any address outside of Charlottesville as being "too far" to be safe
  - Any non-Charlottesville customers have been made aware of this
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## A note about travel
- Note that "Charlottesville" includes the City of Charlottesville, as well as any location in Albemarle County that lists "Charlottesville" as the town on their address
- Like the other restrictions, this is not a judgement on you (or your driving skills!)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Emaling the customer
- Wait until I give the go ahead!
- Introduce yourself, and tell them that you are on the project team that will be working on their SLP project
  - Their emails are in the requirements document
- Be polite and professional!
- Propose some times to meet, based on the team's schedule
  - But be open to other meeting times
  - And mention any travel restrictions
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Changes and updates already made...
- Updated course server account information
  - In particular, the group account information
- The github repos are all ready, and you all have access to your group repos
  - Except for meals -- we have to handle that separately
- You now have access to the [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo, which we'll talk about on Wednesday
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Stuff on my todo list...
- At some point today or tomorrow you will receive from me:
  - A e-mail from me that is the go-ahead to contact the customer
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it1goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1, part 1
- Fully understand the requirements
  - Generate questions to ask the customer!
  - This may mean that the requirements document is updated or changed; the original source version is in the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) in three formats: HTML, PDF, and Markdown
- Meet with the customer
  - As the questions that you generated!
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
  - And enter it into your course server group DB, or generate the DB tables (into that DB) via Rails or Django
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1, part 2
- Get your dev environment set up
  - See the [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo for guidance, as well as the [development environment setup](../docs/dev-env-setup.html) page
- Get a basic MVC website working on the course server (CRUD operations for the schema tables)
  - This should all be working on the course server by the end of the iteration
- Everybody must add themselves to their basecamp project
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1, part 3
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo
  - You are all members of your respective repos
  - ~~I will give directions for initalizing the repo later this week~~ (done!)
  - ***PASSWORDS ARE NOT TO BE STORED IN THE REPO***
    - This includes MySQL passwords; we can chat about how to best store these later
  - Your system should be in an app/ directory, or similar
    - Don't have all the various files for the Django/Rails/CakePHP in the root directory....
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1, part 4
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues
  - We'll talk about this in an upcoming class, so please wait until then
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration!
  - Even if your work is not code based, commit something
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Nametags
- I have a set of "Hello, my name is..." nametags with me for each group
  - Do *not* fill in "Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
- And a Sharpie marker for each group
  - They are too hard to read when written in pen or pencil
- You are to use these in each of the *customer* meetings until you run out
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## For the rest of today's lecture
- Split off into groups
  - Introduce yourselves!
  - Select leads and a secretaries for the year
  - Select a platform, if you can decide on one today
  - Fill out that information on the [SLP Project Start Information Sheet](../uva/project-start-info-sheet-2017.pdf), and turn that in before you leave
- Look over the requirements document
- Generate a list of questions and clarifications that you want to get from the customer
  - The secretary should take notes!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Meeting your groups
- I selected meeting locations for each group
  - It's a [local file](../../../work/slp/groups/meeting-locations.png), and also on the next slide
- And if you forgot your project assignment already, that's in this [local file](../../../work/slp/groups/groups.html)
  - Or you can look it up on Collab
