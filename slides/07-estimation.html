## What is a task: user stories
>  A user story is one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user or user of a system that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function

- from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is a task: use cases
- Just a prose (i.e. English) explanation of what's happening
  - Play a dice game: player requests to roll the dice.  System presents results: if the dice face value totals seven, player wins; otherwise, player looses.
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What is a task: use cases
- Three types:
  - Brief: one-paragraph summary (like the one 2 slides ago) that covers the 'happy path'
    - This is like a user story
  - Casual: multiple-paragraph format that covers multiple scenarios
  - Fully dressed: highly detailed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What unit to estimate a task in?
- Waterfall methods use time (hours/days/etc.)
  - But this does not differentiate between hard tasks (coding) and mundane tasks (documentation)
  - And how can one really predict time taken?
- Agile methodologies often uses *effort*
  - Often measured in *story points*
  - So a hard and short task may rate the same as a long and easy task
  - Note that effort is relative, so the estimates may well vary
  - Note that story points != hours!!!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What scale to estimate with?
- Lots of choices:
  - Numeric sizing: 1 to 10
  - T-shirt sizes: XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL
  - Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.
    - Some upper limit here, such as 13 or 21
    - Tasks > 21 should be split into smaller tasks
  - Dog breeds: Chihuahua (small) to Great Dane (large)
- It matters not, as long as the scale is agreed upon
- We'll use the Fibonacci sequence
  - Although I'm open to teams using custom ones...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## What about unknown task lengths?
- Often this will be overestimated: 10, XXXL, 21, etc.
  - By splitting it into smaller tasks, you can better estimate the individual parts
- One purpose of the inception step is to estimate how much the tasks might take so that they aren't all listed as Great Danes
  - And our iteration 1 is inception-like
- And you can use rapid prototyping, research, short sprints, etc., to gain better estimates
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Calibrating our scale
- 4 story points is what one person on each team can accomplish in a single 2-week iteration
  - As per UVa guildelines, you are expected to be spending about 9 hours per week on this course outside lecture
  - So one story point is about 4 hours of work
- This means that 24 (for 6 person groups), 28 (for 7 person groups), or 32 (for 8 person groups) story points can be completed per iteration
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Calibrating our scale
- There are 14 iterations, which means 14*24 = 336 story points for the entire project for a 6 person group
  - 392 for 7 person groups
  - 448 for 8 person groups
- But the last 3 iterations are transition, so 11\*24 = 264 story points (for 6 person groups) are expected to be completed prior to transition
  - 11\*28 = 308 for 7 person groups
  - 11\*32 = 352 for 8 person groups
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## At the start of each iteration...
- There are a certain number (say, *n*) of "story points" to be completed in each iteration
  - ...or t-shirt sizes...
  - ...or dog breeds...
- Each task has a priority
- So we choose *n* story points worth of tasks, picking the highest priority tasks first
- In Scrum, this is moving the user stories from the product backlog to the sprint backlog
  - We wil do this via a github issue milestone
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Are there better estimation methods?
- Yes, but we won't see them in this practicum
- They can be rather dry to lecture on (or listen to)...
	  </script></section>

# Procedure
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Marking off tasks
- All of our tasks will be github issues
- We have to do 24 (or 28 or 32) story points of "stuff" in this iteration
  - And thus you should be entering and marking off tasks during this iteration
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Marking off tasks
- Do <font color='red'>NOT</font> make up tasks to hit this number!
  - It's meant as a guide; I am not going to hold you to that number
    - But if you don't enter any tasks, I will assume you are not doing any work
  - I will get very cranky if dumb tasks are created to hit that number
- Once completed, you can mark off that task as completed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Release length
- If we have an estimate as to the number of story points in the entire project
  - This (hopefully) will estimated during inception (iteration 1)
- ...and a "threshold" for how many story points will be completed during a sprint...
  - And, presumably, the sprint length we are using
- We can divide one by the other to get an estimate of how many sprints the project will take
  - And thus we can compute how long the project will take
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Release length
- Estimates not guaranteed to be 100% accurate
  - But in our case, the number of sprints is fixed
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Wait... we are aiming for a target?
- In most projects, you determine what the customer wants, and then estimate how much money and time it will take
- But our projects are fixed in terms of resources (people and time)
- So we can only do about 264 (or 308 or 352) story points on this project
- Thus, we will have to scale our requirements to meet this goal
  - I realize this is not how it is done in practice...

## Release progress
- We can track how many "story points" of things got completed in each iteration, and plot that
- This is called the release burndown

## Realistic release burndown
- The next slide is the release burndown from last year's class
  - You can see all the previous ones starting [here](02-development-methods.html#/burndown)
- It plots story points left to complete versus the iteration
- Can we do better this year?

## Github iteration milestones
- EACH iteration will have it's own milestone (named "iteration 1", "iteration 14", etc.)
  - Again, don't change the spacing or characters, but I don't care about the capitalization you use
- When you are moving tasks from the product backlog into the sprint backlog, you just assign them to that particular milestone
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Github priority tags
- EACH issue in github must have a priority tag
- We'll use: immediate, very-high, high, medium, low, very-low, unknown
- The tags should be named exactly that (I don't care about capitalization)
  - You can also make the tags be "priority-XXX", if you want, where XXX is the priorities listed above
- If you do not put a priority tag on each issue, then my automated script will start throwing all sorts of errors, and I'll have to track you down to fix it, which will just make me cranky
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Github story point tags
- EACH issue in github must *also* have a tag indicating the story points
  - "story-points-13", "story-points-1", etc.
    - Using the Fibonacci numbers, as discussed previously
  - Make sure these tags are exactly as specified here!
    - Don't add spaces, use underlines, etc.
    - But I don't care about the capitalization case you use
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Github story point tags
- If you do not put a story point tag on each issue, then my automated script will start throwing all sorts of errors, and I'll have to track you down to fix it, which will just make me cranky
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Using your own scale
- Your scale should have some concept of size
  - So gummy bear colors is not all that useful...
- You are welcome to use your own scale of story points, with the following restrictions:
  - What you use must map to the Fibonacci numbers
    - And thus you must do the equivalent of 4 story points per user per iteration
  - Your custom github tags must all begin with "story-points-"
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Using your own scale
- You must provide me a mapping of your tags to the Fibonacci numbers; for example:
  - "story-points-chihuahua" maps to "story-points-1"
  - "story-points-great-dane" maps to "story-points-21"
  - Etc.
- Realize that I may have to modify your scale a bit...
  - I have to ensure my script works with that scale
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Current alternative scales
- Dogs: chihuahua, poodle, terrier, border-collie, retriever, great-dane, clifford
- T-shirt sizes: xs, s, m, l, xl, xxl, xxxl
- These all map, respectively, to 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
- You don't have to let me know if you are using these *exact* scales
- Otherwise, let's chat
  - As I have to modify a script to handle a new scale
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Zero story points?
- Sure, this can happen
  - Usually when one realizes that a task is not necessary
- Just use "story-points-0" or "story-points-none" as the tag
  - Or something else, if you give me the mapping

## Conclusion
- At the end of iteration 1, we will ask:
  - How many total story points in each system? And how many are left?
  - Do they all have priorities and story points?
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Conclusion
- At the end of iteration 1, we will ask:
  - Does the "iteration 1" milestone have tasks assigned to it?
    - And were those tasks completed?
    - We realize that, since we are just getting started, that the story points completed in iteration 1 may not be the expected amount
    - But it should be as close as possible! 264 or 308 or 352 story points, depending on group size
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="task"><script type="text/template">
## Today's task...
- Decide on the story point unit you want to use
  - And send me the mapping, if necessary
- Create the labels in github's issues for both priorities and story points
- Create the 14 milestones
- Enter *all* your issues in github
  - Estimate the effort for each task using your scale, and assign a priority to each
- Assign tasks to the "iteration 1" milestone
  - You can add completed tasks (just mark them as done and give them story points and priority tags)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="task"><script type="text/template">
## Today's task...
- You will not likely finish this all today, but it should be finished by the end of this iteration
