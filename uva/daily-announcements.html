## Monday, September 25th
- Office hours are in the [syllabus](syllabus.html)
- The homeworks are (mostly) all finished and are being graded
- We are half-way through iteration 1
- Leads: your first report is due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reports) for details
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- Remember you have to report hours at least once each iteration
- Remember about how to [reserve a room for the meetings](#/meetingsrsvp); and about the [meeting report format](course-introduction-fall.html#/meetingreport)
- Your journal prompt is due tomorrow by noon; see [here](#/journaling) for details
- Basecamp info will be out later this week
- The course server will have a bit of downtime this week (hopefully less than 15 minutes a piece)
- Today is a group work day
  - This Wednesday we will see [project estimation](../slides/07-estimation.html), so please wait until then to start entering all your github issues
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Python & Django versions
- Django 1.11.5 recently came out (on September 5th)
  - It's a security release
  - 1.11.4 was installed everywhere previously
- You all will need to upgrade
  - On the VirtualBox image: `sudo -H pip install Django==1.11`
  - If you are using docker: `docker pull aaronbloomfield/slp`
    - And if you did a tag for the previous one, do that again: `docker tag aaronbloomfield/slp slp`
  - And on your own custom install, as well
- The course server has 1.11.5 on it now
- For those who are familiar with it, we will all be switching over to virtualenv in a few weeks
- The default version of Python on the course server will be changing to Python 3, but that has to wait until *after* the homeworks are all graded
  - So in a month or so
  - Since that may (temporarily) break your system, we will give you a heads-up before doing that
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Today's group work day
- We will sign the [legal agreement](student-participation-form.pdf) (specifically, [this version](student-participation-form-for-tpegs-with-footer.pdf))
  - Some groups will also be signing the [open source agreement](open-source-agreement.pdf)
- You will also be scheduling your bi-weekly meeting with Inkee, the graduate TA
  - Thus, please have access to your schedules!
- Fill out your scheduling preferences at https://goo.gl/B62htt
  - Fill out all the spots that your *entire* group can make it
  - Inkee will get back to you as to when your meeting is
  - If you select times on Oct 6, then you will meet at that time during the *first* week of each iteration
  - If you select times on Oct 13, then you will meet at that time during the *second* week of each iteration
- Other than that, what you talk about is up to you
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1
See [here](../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals) for full details, but briefly:

- Fully understand the requirements
- Meet with the customer
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
- Get your dev environment set up (see [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) for guidance)
- Get a basic MVC site working on the course server
  - Once done, this will require you emailing me so that I can complete the apache2 configuration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo (no passwords!!!)
  - That means having all your framework created files in an app/ folder!
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues (this is next Wednesday)
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration (and, in general, every iteration)

## Wednesday, September 20th
- Office hours: Bloomfield's: M/W 1-2:30; Ibrahim's: M 5-6:30 & W 1:30-3
- The homeworks are (mostly) all finished!  Yay!  They are being graded...
- You are welcome to use the VirtualBox Linux image for your development, or install Django natively on your machine
- Leads: your first report is due *next* Tuesday at noon; I will remind you about it next Monday in class
  - My email to new leads went out last night
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- Next Monday is a group work day, and is when you will be scheduling your bi-weekly meeting with Inkee, the graduate TA
  - Thus, please have access to your schedules!
  - We will also sign the [legal agreement](student-participation-form.pdf) then (specifically, [this version](student-participation-form-for-tpegs-with-footer.pdf))
    - Some groups will also be signing the [open source agreement](open-source-agreement.pdf)
- Remember you have to report hours at least once each iteration
- Today we will be will be starting and finishing the [customer meetings](../slides/06-customer-meetings.html#/) slide set
  - Next Wednesday we will see [project estimation](../slides/07-estimation.html), so please wait until then to start entering all your github issues
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Remembering all this stuff...
- We are giving you a *lot* of information, both in the slide sets and in the daily announcements
  - We don't actually expect you to have it all memorized!
  - But you are responsible for it, however
- We aim to have all the relevant info in the daily announcements, with links to the appropriate places
- So always look online at the daily announcements from the most recent day
  - Online URL: http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/uva/daily-announcements.html
  - And if you go to http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/ you can navigate there in 3 clicks...
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown id="meetingsrsvp"><script type="text/template">
## Meeting room reminders
- Some reservation reminders:
- Swing by Rice 527 (the main CS office) or email cs-office@virginia.edu to reserve a conference room for a meeting
- Be sure to tell them that you are in this capstone class!
- Please only make meetings for when you are meeting with the customer or grad TA
  - Although the grad TA will make the latter ones for you
- Please only make meetings for the times you need, and use it for those times!
- I am very sorry that there are not more rooms for you all to meet separately
  - That being said, if you squat in a room, the worst that will happen is that somebody will just ask you to leave...
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown id="journaling"><script type="text/template">
## Journaling!
- Every iteration you will have a *journal prompt*, which will ask you to reflect on something in writing
  - Some will require a reading prior to the written reflection!
- You will have to respond to it by the Tuesday mid-way through the iteration, by noon
  - I will remind you about it next Monday, but it is your responsibility to remember to enter it on time
  - The submissions close that Friday (3 days after the due date) at noon
- You enter it through the course management system
- These are graded!  Partial credit will be awarded for late entries.
- We are looking for honest and *concise* responses, not a long-winded diatribe
  - If you put fluff or BS into your response, you will automatically get a zero
  - We are looking for quality over quantity
  - That being said, it should be well English
- The prompt for iteration 1 is open and ready for you to submit
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Iteration 1 journal prompt

Other than the course credit and graduation requirements, what -- if anything -- do you hope to gain from this year's capstone experience? Also, what are your biggest concerns that you have about the project, group, nonprofit, or customer? Please no fluff or BS -- if there is nothing you hope to gain, or you have no concerns, please just honestly state so (and explain why). Your grade for this is based on an honest reflection, not a sycophantic reflection.
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project notes and erratta
- The course server will have some downtime in the next week or so, but it should be short (less than 15 minutes at a time, at least two times)
- Communication tools: we will be using basecamp, which will be set up for you within the next week
- Note that the intent is for *all* of the group to be present at the customer (and graduate TA) meetings
- We have now entered our "tyipcal" schedule: group meetings (in class) on Mondays, lecture or in-class workday on Wednesdays, and no class on Fridays
- If you are interested, the entire list of iteration goals is in the [iteration goals slide set](iteration-goals.html#/)
  - Keep in mind that there may be a few tweaks to future goals, but I don't expect much to change
  - I will cut-and-paste the relevant goals from that into the daily announcements, so you don't have to check that file if you don't want to
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## My Todos: All Done!
- Customers have been notified that the projects have started, so you are free to email them
- There are now group accounts (and databases) on the course server; the updated account info is in PostEm
  - Keep in mind that PostEm will be moving to the course administration tool in the next few days...
  - You are more than welcome to change the team password, if you would like (but make it something secure!)
  - Or you can set up [password free login](../docs/dev-env-setup.html)
- The github repos are all ready, and issues and the wiki have been enabled on each
  - I did an initial commit for each
  - meals group: your situation is slightly different, so please chat with me after class today
- You have access to the [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo
  - Many of these will be quite useful in getting your account and development environment set up
  - Be wary, though -- as with everything online, some may be out of date

## Course management tool

- We'll see it now: https://slp.cs.virginia.edu:444/admin/
- Note the oddball port number!!!
- If you go to https://slp.cs.virginia.edu, and click on "For Current Students", you will be redirected there
- Specific URL we'll be using today (a fake user): https://slp.cs.virginia.edu:444/admin/users/student/243
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Attendance check-in
- This is how we will take attendance during lectures
- Please check-in now:
  - Go to http://tinyurl.com/slpcheckin
  - Once that redirects (to https://slp.cs.virginia.edu:444/admin/checkins/checkin), you will need to Netbadge in
  - That's it!
  - Future check-ins may have you enter a code, but today doesn't
- Again, please check in *now*; I'll wait!
- Remember: if you miss class for a *valid* reason, you can submit an attendance excuse via the course management system

## Year Start Survey
- Everybody must complete this survey by the "end of the day" on Friday
  - If you don't, you won't get assigned to a project, and then you cannot complete this course
  - I will send you periodic reminders about this through the rest of this week, so no need to panic and fill it out today, necessarily
- The survey prompt will be mailed to you today
  - That email is tagged to your userid, so we know who you are...
- The survey system has an annoying *timeout* "feature"
  - If it is idle for too long, any responses on that page that you have not submitted are lost
  - This really only happens when people keep it open, leave for lunch (or whatever), and then come back
  - It's a really stupid design, I know...
- The survey questions are on Collab in Resources/surveys/year-start, and you can veiw it from there
  - There are 4 pages: [page 1][1], [page 2][2], [page 3][3], [page 4][4]
  - So if you want to ponder your responses, you can view it there first
- Let's go over the survey...

[1]: https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/9d516a99-7444-481d-b79c-521b6f1ad522/surveys/year-start/year-start-p1.html

[3]: https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/9d516a99-7444-481d-b79c-521b6f1ad522/surveys/year-start/year-start-p3.html

	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Optimizing the Survey
- If your responses are too constrained, I won't be able to even come close to fulfilling them
  - List more than project as a '5', for example (and multiple ones as a '4')
  - You are not selecting which one project you want to work on -- instead, you are telling us which *MULTIPLE* projects you are *willing* to work on
- Requesting special situations
  - If you have an *entire* 7 person group that you want to work with, you have to:
    - Have *each* potential group member list all of you to work with (in the end comments)
    - List similar choices for projects, platforms, etc.
    - Be *very* flexible in which group (such as stating that you will work on any of them)
  - Unfortunately, it is not possible to match up smaller groups to work together (too many constraints for the project assignment)
  - Mortal Enemies can also be people you like, but don't want to work with (I had an engaged pair list each other as mortal enemies once)
- If you state that you are not willing to work on an open source project, then you definitely will *not* be assigned to those two groups
- If you do have any connection to a given project (or framework), please not that in the comments as well (on the preferences page)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Survey "homework"
- It is worth 5 points
- If you complete it by Saturday at 8 a.m. you get 5/5
- If you complete it after that but before Saturday at 8 p.m. you get 2/5
- If you do not complete it by Saturday at 8 p.m. we will drop you from the course
  - We have other people who want to get into the course, and we will move them in instead
  - The system will close the survey at 8 p.m. on Saturday
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Today's lecture
- We have gone over all the material that we need to
  - As promised, we won't waste your time with something not relevant
- The rest of today's lecture is an open work session
- You can use it to:
  - Read about the projects
  - Ask questions about the projects
  - Ask questions about the survey
  - Complete the survey
  - See how much Djagno (and Rails) we really know...
  - Complain about the homeworks.  Or weather.  Or anything at all, really.
- You are not required to stay any longer, though

## Friday, September 1st
- Office hours: Bloomfield's are M/W 1:00-2:30, Ibrahim's are M 5:00-6:30 and W 1:30-3:00
- More on enrollment on another slide...
- The next two homeworks (Django tutorial and Rails tutorial) are ready
  - Django is due on Monday (9/4), Rails on Friday (9/8)
    - Make sure the expected URLs and the passwords are correct, otherwise we can't grade your HW!
  - The server is all ready to go, and the directions for configuring your projects on the server (from the [docs page of the repo](../docs/index.html) are ready
  - Account information in the PostEm tool
  - Late add?  We'll get your account created this weekend
- There will be "extension" HWs the following week, one in Django and one in Rails; then projects start!
- Piazza is enabled -- post away!
- Docker image is ready; see the [docker usage page](../docs/docker-usage.html) for details
  - The image has been updated; remove your old ones, and get a new one: `docker pull aaronbloomfield/slp` (it operates the same, but is more compact)
    - No more authentication needed to pull the image
  - You can build it yourself: the Dockerfile is in the repo

## Friday, September 1st
- We also have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - The link is http://tinyurl.com/y83lv7sd
  - That is an updated version (and link); if you downloaded it before 9:45 on Fri (8/25), then run the following command (needed for the frameworks HW):
  - `sudo apt-get install g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 libc6-dev:i386 flex`
  - Make sure you specify that it's a 64-bit guest!
  - Also see the [installation instructions](../docs/virtualbox-intro.html) and the [image details](../docs/virtualbox-image-details.html)
- Unlike CS 2150, it doesn't matter what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  We've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Windows to run WAMP...
- If you are just adding the course, please fill out the github userid survey at https://goo.gl/9YpXTL right away

## Enrollment update	      
- Since we are going to have at least 15 projects, we can now let 15*7 = 105 people into the course
- There are 81 enrolled and 27 waiting, for a total of 108
- We are required to give priority to 4th year BS CS majors
  - This was done last night (19 people)
  - Thus, there are 8 people still in limbo
- If you are a 4th year BS CS major and did not get in, please see us right after class today!
- Our hope is to be able to allow everybody else on ~~Friday~~ Monday
- The add deadline is Tuesday, September 5th, so we still have time
- That being said, those wanting into the course should still have done the [git and github HW](../docs/hw-git.html)
- Course server accounts for new course adds will happen as the adds occur
