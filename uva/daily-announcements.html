## Friday, September 1st
- Office hours: Bloomfield's are M/W 1:00-2:30, Ibrahim's are M 5:00-6:30 and W 1:30-3:00
- More on enrollment on another slide...
- The next two homeworks (Django tutorial and Rails tutorial) are ready
  - Django is due on Monday (9/4), Rails on Friday (9/8)
    - Make sure the expected URLs and the passwords are correct, otherwise we can't grade your HW!
  - The server is all ready to go, and the directions for configuring your projects on the server (from the [docs page of the repo](../docs/index.html) are ready
  - Account information in the PostEm tool
  - Late add?  We'll get your account created this weekend
- There will be "extension" HWs the following week, one in Django and one in Rails; then projects start!
- Piazza is enabled -- post away!
- Docker image is ready; see the [docker usage page](../docs/docker-usage.html) for details
  - The image has been updated; remove your old ones, and get a new one: `docker pull aaronbloomfield/slp` (it operates the same, but is more compact)
    - No more authentication needed to pull the image
  - You can build it yourself: the Dockerfile is in the repo
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Friday, September 1st
- We also have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - The link is http://tinyurl.com/y83lv7sd
  - That is an updated version (and link); if you downloaded it before 9:45 on Fri (8/25), then run the following command (needed for the frameworks HW):
  - `sudo apt-get install g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 libc6-dev:i386 flex`
  - Make sure you specify that it's a 64-bit guest!
  - Also see the [installation instructions](../docs/virtualbox-intro.html) and the [image details](../docs/virtualbox-image-details.html)
- Unlike CS 2150, it doesn't matter what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  We've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Windows to run WAMP...
- If you are just adding the course, please fill out the github userid survey at https://goo.gl/9YpXTL right away
  - I will need that information to get your assignments graded, and to release the project information to you
- It looks like we *will* have class next Friday
- Today we will work through [legal issues](../slides/01-legal.html#/) (starting [here](../slides/01-legal.html#/nda)), and then onto [development methodologies](../slides/02-development-methods.html#/)

## Project Status
- 3 have their descriptions finalized
- 4 have (mostly) final drafts written, but have not yet been finalized
- 4 are definitely going to happen, but need to have their descriptions written up
- 6 are still in the planning phase

14 are definite, 1 is 90% likely, and 2 are possibilities

It looks like we will have at least 15 projects, possibly as many as 17
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Enrollment update	      
- Since we are going to have at least 15 projects, we can now let 15*7 = 105 people into the course
- There are 81 enrolled and 27 waiting, for a total of 108
- We are required to give priority to 4th year BS CS majors
  - This was done last night (19 people)
  - Thus, there are 8 people still in limbo
- If you are a 4th year BS CS major and did not get in, please see us right after class today!
- Our hope is to be able to allow everybody else on ~~Friday~~ Monday
- The add deadline is Tuesday, September 5th, so we still have time
- That being said, those wanting into the course should still have done the [git and github HW](../docs/hw-git.html)
- Course server accounts for new course adds will happen as the adds occur
