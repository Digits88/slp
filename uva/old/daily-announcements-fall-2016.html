## Monday, December 5th
- We are at the middle of iteration 6
  - Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - Iteration 5 evaluations were released; you have ONLY ONE week (until Mon, 12/12) to request a re-evaluation
    - If you won't meet with Jordan during that time, send him an email to either express your concerns or to schedule a time to meet
  - There will not be a *full* iteration 6 evaluation
    - We will *not* do the group evaulation and the group rating
    - Instead, there will be an overall project evaluation
    - All other parts of the iteration 6 evaluation (time submitted, leadership duties, etc.) will be done
- Keep in mind that your CI builds should never be failing!
- Everybody will need to upload their prospectus to the course system
  - As of this morning, 51 students have not done so
- Don't forget to report your hours!
- Homework regrades are all done!  (with one exception)
- Office hours for me will now be by appointment only
- Today is a group work day, and our final day this semester
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="PleasePayAttentionInLecture"><script type="text/template">
## Final project notes
- We have a (small) individual project in lieu of a final exam
- Full project details [here](#/finalproject)
- Some people are finding it hard to get information on some nonprofits
  - If so, then fill out the form as best you can with whatever information you do have
  - If information is not available, fill out "none" in that field, and explain in detail in the Notes field at the bottom
  - This includes nonprofits that do not seem to exist, as well as nonprofits without an email address (only phone contact info)
- Please complete it by 5 p.m. on Thursday, December 8th
  - That time is when the final exam slot for this course ends
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it6goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 6
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Submit an 'other' report that contains credentials to log in (possibly multiple credentials for various user levels)
- Get customer feedback on the preliminary system (from the last iteration), and iterate on that design
- Complete the final system that implements the minimum requirements, and have it working on the course server
- Ensure that your requirements document is fully updated!
- Have the customer start using and testing the system via an email, CC'ed to me, that requests that they start testing the sytsem over break
  - Also mention that you'll likely be out of contact until mid-January
- Complete a preliminary *deployment plan*: a Markdown document in your repo as docs/deployment-plan.md that has all the known deployment info
- Complete 5 more unit tests per person (total now is 15+ per person)
- Meet with the grad TA and demo your final system
  - If the meeting time is doing to cause scheduling issues (during a final, after you've left grounds, etc.), you can request a different time to meet
  - If you meeting is early in the iteration, it's fine if some functionality is not yet finished; we can check that when it's all done
- Three individual tasks: complete the individual project, upload your STS prospectus, and (at the end) phase-change survey
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Sample Grading Metric
- This is a reminder from the [course introduction slide set](course-introduction-fall.html#/grades)
- Base metric
  - 50%: iteration evaluations
  - 30%: final project evaluation
  - 10%: homeworks
  - 10%: project in lieu of the final exam
- Modifications
  - Group work is multiplied by a *factor*, which is an estimate of how much work you did for the group
    - You saw a preliminary estimate of this in the individual mid-semester evaluations
  - Penalties for missing class or not completing your reported times
  - Massive penalties for not completing the surveys
- As promised, you will get an A in the course if ALL of the following are true:
  - All 'good' group evaluations (or evals that average to 'good')
  - Doing an 'average' amount of work
  - Getting 93% in the homeworks and the final project
  - No penalties for missed attendance, missed reported hours, or missed surveys
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Remaining schedule
- ~~Wednesday, 11/30: group meeting in lecture~~
- Monday, 12/5: group meeting in lecture (today)
  - Make sure the lead submits the weekly report
- Thursday, 12/8: final projects due by 5 p.m.
- Sunday, 12/11: phase-change survey released
- Monday, 12/12: iteration 6 ends:
  - Make sure the lead submits the TPS report
  - Make sure you complete the [iteration 6 goals](#/it6goals)
- Tuesday, 12/13: grading metrics released
  - This may be delayed one day if it ends up taking us more time...
  - Once released, you will receive an email, and you will have only 24 hours to submit a regrade
- Thrusday, 12/15: final grades released
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Holiday Break
- I will do my best not to bother you until we return. But...
- If something goes wrong with the system, or the customer can't use it, then I'll start sending emails
- The customer may (or may not) email you
- My hope is that I don't have to contact anybody (I want a break from course work too...)
	  </script></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Preview of next semester
- This isn't really the end; we are only half-way through our capstone
- Next semester we will pick up right where we left off ...
  - ... with a group meeting on Wed, Jan 18th
  - Class meets on M/W from 10:00-10:50; group meetings on Mondays, lectures on Wednesdays
  - We generally won't have lectures on Fridays (but we will at the very end of the semester)
- Grades for both semesters will be completely independent
- There will be more lectures next semester
  - On deliverables, testing, etc.; see [here](../../slides/index.html) for details
- There will be 8 iterations instead of 6
  - The first 5 will be development; the last 3 deployment
  - Different group sizes will have a different phase schedule as a result
  - Desired requirements will need to be completed by late March
    - Specifically, at the end of iteration 11
- Iterations will have specific deliverables
  - Deployment plan, test plan, transition plan, etc.
- Some documentation during the last 3 iterations
  - Technical report, user manual, installation instructions, programming reference
  - I will guide you through all of these
- And, of course, lots of progress on your projects!

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Checklist to get outta here

    - Do a mini "hand-off" to the customer, and CC me; details in the iteration 6 goals
    - Ensure that your requirements document is updated
    - Have the final group meeting with the grad TA, where you will demo your system
  - Leads: submit the weekly and TPS reports at the appropriate time
    - I won't be able to remind you, since there won't be classes then!
    - And the rest of the group should check to make sure they are submitted
- Individually:
  - Complete your [final project](../../docs/project-nonprofit-data-collection.html) by 5 p.m. on Thursday, December 8th

  - Make sure you have registered for CS 4971 for the spring
  - Once the grading metrics are released (likely Tuesday, Dec 13 or Wednesday, Dec 14), review them and respond, if necessary, within 24 hours
  - Continue to report your hours

## Project in lieu of a final
- Instead of a final exam, there will be a small project
- It is expected to take well under 3 hours, which is the time that a final would actually take (not counting studying)
  - I expect it will take about an hour
- The full assignment is [here](../../docs/project-nonprofit-data-collection.html)
  - You have to actually read that through!
- Basically, it is the collection of data so that I can email local nonprofits in future years for SLP
- Everybody has 8 or 9 nonprofits to collect the information for
- It is due by the end of the final exam period (5 p.m. on Thursday, December 8th)
- If you do a good job, you get a 10
  - If I have to re-enter information, or you do a shoddy job, or you don't read the directions, then you get a zero
- The URL to enter the data will be emailed to you shortly
- Your assigned nonprofits will be shortly available in the PostEm tab of the course management tool

- Individual evaluations are out; we'll talk about them shortly
- With the end of iteration 4, there is another *phase change*

## Individual evaluations
- You can view these in the PostEm tab of the course management system
- These are not used *directly* in determining the final course grade
  - We will re-determine things at the end of the semester; that updated one will count in your final grade
  - But it provides a good idea of what we are thinking at this point
- Many of the fields are information stored elsewhere
  - Reported hours, content from the evaluations, etc.
- Other fields can't be determined until the end of the semester
- The most important fields are:
  - unexcused absences
  - iterations without any reported times
  - surveys not completed (although everybody currently has zero here)
  - mid-semester individual rating of the work you are doing
  - mid-semester individual rating comments
  - notes, resposnes, and special cases (this is all 1 field)
- Pretty much every other field is simply restating information you have seen elsewhere

## Sample Grading Metric
- This is a reminder from the [course introduction slide set](course-introduction-fall.html#/grades)
- Base metric
  - 50%: iteration evaluations
  - 30%: final project evaluation
  - 10%: homeworks
  - 10%: final exam, project, or presentation
- Modifications
  - Group work is multiplied by a *factor*, which is an estimate of how much work you did for the group
  - Penalties for missing class or not completing your reported times
  - Massive penalties for not completing the surveys
- This is all subject to change, of course...

## Challenging your evaluation
- Please keep in mind that our information is imperfect!
  - The reason we do this evaluation is to give you a chance to correct any misconceptions that have occurred
  - And to make changes moving forward
- Yet you still have wrath to vent!  How to do so?
- If we got something wrong, we want you to let us know!
- Please fill out a regrade for the "Individual mid-semester evaluation, fall 2016" assignment
  - Make it clear what we missed!  And any evidence that supports your claim
- We will process these, consider each one, and (eventually) repsond to each one
- However, we are *NOT* going to be updating that PostEm entry with the results
  - You can see the response when you view your regrade
- Please submit any regrades within two weeks from today (so until November 30th)

## Monday, November 14th
- We are at the end of iteration 4
  - Leads: your TPS reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - Iteration 3 evaluations were released; you have two weeks (From Mon, 11/7) to request a re-evaluation
  - We hope to have the iteration 4 evaluations out by the end of this week
- Individual evaluations should be out by Wednesday's lecture; we'll talk about them then
- With the end of iteration 4, there will be another *phase change*
  - This means new leads and secretaries
  - And a phase change survey again; you'll receive an email about this later today
- About course registration for next semester
- Don't forget to report your hours!
- All homework grades are now posted
  - Rails and Django regrades are enabled for a two week period (until November 17th)
- Individual evaluations will be out early to mid of next week
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
- Today is a group work day
  - As we approach the end of the semester, there are fewer "useful" lectures for me to present

## Goals for Iteration 4
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Everybody should complete 5 more unit tests
  - You don't need to also do a fixture, as long as you did one in the last iteration
  - This means you should have at least 10 unit tests per team member
- The wireframes should be (presumably) finalized, and likely implemented, by the end of this iteration
  - Please still keep copies in the docs/wireframes directory in your repo!
- As the iterations continue, there will be fewer specific requirements (other than "do work" and "write tests")
- Keep in mind that at the end of iteration 5, you will have to have a preliminary version of the final system running on the course server
  - Here, "the final system" means the system that impelements the minimum requirements
  - Are you keeping your reqirements document updated?

## Moving over to virtualenv
- On pegasus, using the `virtualenv` command, create your virtual environment
  - Pick a reasonable directory name: ~/venv-django-1.10, or whatever:
```
virtualenv ~/venv-django-1.10
```
  - Add "`-p /usr/bin/python3`" right after "`virtualenv`" if you are using Python 3
- Email me the directory name so I can configure the web server
  - Not much will work until that's configured properly; I can do this quickly
- Enter the virtual environment: from the command line, enter:
```
source ~/venv-django-1.10/bin/activate
```
  - You will notice a difference in the prompt
  - You can leave the virtual environment by entering `deactivate` (or just logging out)
- Install the packages that you need via pip (or pip3, if you are using Python3):
```
pip install foo
pip install bar==1.2.3
```
  - Your installation instructions will list all the packages (and versions) that you need installed!
- Reload the web server as needed: `/usr/local/bin/reload-apache2`

## Today's task
- Today we will be working on the CI testing setup
- No groups are fully there yet (which is fine, since it's due at the end of the iteration)
  - 9 (of 15) groups have passing builds, but nobody has a significant number of their unit tests written yet
  - In addition, recall that each *person* must contribute at least 5 valid test cases (and one fixture per person; and at least one test must use that fixture)
- To do today:
  - Get Travis or Circle configured for your project: extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test), [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test), and [rails-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/rails-test))
  - Contribute the desired number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
- At the end of today's class, all the build status badges should be green!
- A note about container usage
  - We only have one container for all 15 groups; this will cause delays if everybody pushes their commits around the same time, as they get queued up
  - If you are just doing unit tests, then please hold off on pushing those to let all the groups configure their builds (i.e., generate green status bars)
  - You should be able to run the unit tests in your development environment, so you can confirm to yourself that they works

## Attendance check-in
- Please do a check-in now:
  - Go to http://tinyurl.com/slpcheckin
  - Once that redirects (to https://slp.cs.virginia.edu:444/admin/checkins/checkin), you will need to Netbadge in
  - Enter the code: "travis"
    - Please maintain the same case and what-not
- Remember: if you miss class for a *valid* reason, you can submit an attendance excuse via the course management system

## Monday, October 24th
- We are in the middle of iteration 3
  - Leads: your weekly reports are due tomorrow by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - Iteration 2 evaluations were released late last week; you have two weeks (From Mon, 10/24) to request a re-evaluation
  - With the end of iteration 2, all groups had a *phase change*: new leads and secretaries
- Phase change survey
  - See [here](#/phasechangesurvey) and [here](#/citestingsetup) for details
  - It must be completed very soon; reminders were sent last night
- Don't forget to report your hours!
- The Cake and the git/github HW grades are posted, and regrades are enabled for a week or two.
  - Rails and Django grades should be posted shortly
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- All the course materials can be found online at http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp (or /pdr for CS 2150 stuffs)
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
- Today is a group work day
  - Next Wednesday will be a continuous integration work day
  - It will help you quite a bit if you get it actually configured on Travis *before* Wednesday
    - Five groups have done so already
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Goals for Iteration 3
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
  - Some of this will be the work done on the wireframing, some will be the work done on the CI testing
  - Your site should have significnantly more functionality than last time
- In the first week, complete the end-of-phase survey
- Show the wireframe to the customer, get their feedback, iterate on the design
- You will have to configure your site with one of two CI servers: [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.com/) or [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)
  - The [last two slides](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/howtobegin) of the [Continuous Integration Testing](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/) slide set discuss how to begin
  - Each group was assigned to one or the other; assignments are [here](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/assignments)
  - The respective CI server is already set up to run tests on your repo on every push
  - Yout have to write the configuration file to get it to work properly
  - Extensive instructions for how to configure it (as well as sample configured projects) are available: the [CI testing slide set](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html), the [CI setup](../../docs/ci-setup.html) page, and two sample configured repos ([cake3-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake3-test) and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test))
    - Because nobody is using Rails, the rails-test repo was not updated this year, and is not being made available
- You will have to write a number of unit tests (at least 5 per person)
  - And one fixture each!  Note that at least one of your tests has to actually *use* that fixture.

## Phase change survey
- Everybody has to fill it out!
  - It's a course requirement
- The *ONLY* people in the class that will see the results are myself and the graduate TA
  - I encourage you to be open an honest, and I promise I will preserve your anonyminity
- It should take about 10 minutes to complete
- The same survey will be completed after each phase
  - So you will have to complete as many as there are members in your group
- You can see the questions asked [here][5] (it's in Collab, under Resources/surveys/phase-change); it has pages [1][1], [2][2], [3][3], and [4][4]
- There is about a week-long period to fill it out
  - There is a big grade penalty for not filling it out (or just giving quick dummy answers)
- You will receive a survey prompt shortly, as well as increasingly anxious reminders
- There is a *timeout* issue with regard to filling out surveys
  - LimeSurvey (the survey tool being used) will time you out after 10 (or so) minutes -- and then you'll have to start over!
  - So, if you want to spend time thinking about the responses, look over the survey in Collab first!
  - If you do get timed out, I can send you your previouslly completed responses

## CI Testing Setup
- Today is the lecture on [continuous integration testing](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/)
- All of you now have access to three more repos mentioned in that lecture set: [cake-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/cake-test), [rails-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/rails-test), and [django-test](https://github.com/uva-slp/django-test)
  - You will only need to use the one that corresponds to the platform you are using
  - Note that all three of these repos use a slightly older version of the frameworks, but the setup should be the same
    - Let me know if anything doesn't work!
- I will shortly be enabling TravisCI for all of your repos
  - It will email you when a build fails; I wanted to warn you about this before I flipped the switch
  - Note that if a lot of people push their commits at the same time, it will form a long queue of the ones waiting to be tested
- There is an entire page named [Continuous Integration Testing: Getting Started](../../docs/ci-setup.html), and you should read that and the [CI testing slide set](../../slides/09-ci-testing.html#/)

  - Enter the code: "travel"
    - Please maintain the same case and what-not
- Remember: if you miss class for a *valid* reason, you can submit an attendance excuse via the course management system

## Goals for Iteration 2
- Have a site that should start to look like a workable site for the requirements
  - Some just had one or two MVC components for the first iteration (which was fine, as that is what was required for then)
  - Going to http://server/tag should bring up something other than "Hello World", or the Django error page
  - In particular, one should be able to go to the various CRUD operations
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and the grad TA should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes: that's [an entire lecture](../../slides/08-wireframing.html#/); this will likely take 3 or 5 story points of work.  The intent is to show them to the customer in iteration 3
  - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys: see the [Development Environment Setup page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details.  This also includes enabling easy downloading of the database
  - Publishing to the course server is best done via a github web hook and deploy key; see [that same page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details, but only I can set up both of those due to the github security setup
  - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Some things to keep in mind:
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you (although we recommend markdown), but we need to be able to view it
  - Having the source (from the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) copied into a `docs/` directory in your repo is quite reasonable
	  </script></section>

          <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Slack setup
- Each team should have a slack (slack.com) setup enabled, with github integration
  - Likely, you will want to integrate github on a "development" channel
  - But only I can do this (as only I'm an admin for the uva-slp organization)
- The plan:
  - For the first half of today's class, I'll go around to each group
  - During that time, please set up slack for your group
  - In the second half of the class, I'll help you get the github integration set up
  - Note that you should still be having your workday today as well!

## Iteration 1 evaluations
- They were released last night (or early this morning)
- It turns out that most people just ignored the iteration 1 goals...
  - 15 people did not have a git commit
  - 10 people did not submit any hours
  - Most groups did not have a working CRUD website
- Of the 15 group evaluations, 10 were poor, 2 were fair, and 3 were good
  - This directly affects your entire group's grade!
- If you feel we did not judge you fairly, then you may request a re-evaluation within 2 weeks
  - Basically, speak to the graduate TA at your next meeting with him
  - Note that we will *only* judge you based on the work you completed at the end of the iteration; if you completed something afterward, then it doesn't count for the just-ended iteration

  - In particular, one should be able to go to the various CRUD operations
- Complete 4 story points worth of work per group member
- Your regular iteration meeting with the customer and the grad TA should happen
- Specific goals:
  - Generate wireframes: that's [an entire lecture](../../slides/08-wireframing.html#/); this will likely take 3 or 5 story points of work.  The intent is to show them to the customer in iteration 3
  - Enable easy deployment via automatic logins or ssh keys: see the [Development Environment Setup page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details.  This also includes enabling easy downloading of the database
  - Publishing to the course server is best done via a github web hook and deploy key; see [that same page](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/slp/docs/dev-env-setup.html) for details, but only I can set up both of those due to the github security setup
  - Ensure that *everybody* in the development group can develop on his/her own machine
- Some things to keep in mind:
  - Your requrements document will be iterated on throughout the year
  - What format you keep it in is up to you (although we recommend markdown), but we need to be able to view it
  - Having the source (from the [uva-slp/projects repo](https://github.com/uva-slp/projects) repo) copied into a `docs/` directory in your repo is quite reasonable

<h4>Fixing Problems</h4>
<img class="stretch" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fixing_problems.png" title="&#39;What was the original problem you were trying to fix?&#39; &#39;Well, I noticed one of the tools I was using had an inefficiency that was wasting my time.&#39;" alt="Fixing Problems">

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Wednesday, September 28th
- We are half-way through iteration 1
- The homeworks are all finished!  Yay!  We are working on grading them...
- You are welcome to use the VirtualBox Linux image for your development, or install it natively on your machine (more on how to do this shortly)
  - Plasmashell crash issue: the culprit seems to be tooltips, so try disabling them (right click taskbar -> Task Manager Settings -> General -> Uncheck "show tooltips")
- Leads: your weekly report was due yesterday by noon; see [here](course-introduction-fall.html#/reportsinfo) for details
  - Everybody got it in!
  - You submit it via the [course administration system](https://slp.cs.virginia.edu:444/admin/)
  - Your TPS report will be due next Tuesday at noon, and we won't have class the day before for me to remind you...
- You can't `sudo` on the course server, so please stop trying
- My office hours are 9:30-10:30 on Mondays and 9:30-11:30 on Wednesdays
  - But I won't hold mine this Wednesday or next Wednesday unless you mention to me that you'll be there...	
- CS town hall with the CS dept chair!  Did anybody go?  How did it go?
- If you didn't sign the [legal agreement](student-participation-form.pdf) then you will have to do so today
- Schedule
  - Today we will see [project estimation](../../slides/07-estimation.html), and start the estimating
  - Monday is fall break, so no class
  - Next Wednesday will be a group work day
  - The following weeks we will see: wireframing, continuous integration testing, and documentation
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown id="it1goals"><script type="text/template">
## Goals for iteration 1
See [here](../../slides/05-project-start.html#/it1goals) for full details, but briefly:

- Fully understand the requirements
- Meet with the customer
- Design (and implement) a basic DB schema
- Get your dev environment set up (see [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) for guidance)
- Get a basic MVC site working on the course server
  - Once done, this will require you emailing me so that I can complete the apache2 configuration
- Have the system stored properly in the github repo (no passwords!!!)
  - That means having all your framework created files in an app/ folder!
- Enter all the requirements as tasks as Github issues as described [here](../../slides/07-estimation.html#/task)
- Everybody MUST have a github commit this iteration (and, in general, every iteration)
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Getting the site running on the course server
- This is one of the requirements for iteration 1
- You will need to configure it on your end
  - Basically, follow the asme instructions as with the appropriate framework homework
  - For Django, this includes running wsgi-admin
- Then email me, so I can complete the installation
  - There are tweaks and such
  - The URL will then be http://server/tag (for django and rails) or http://server/~tag (for cake)
- Then adjust the system as necessary
- This means it requires some work on my end to get it fully functional
- I am NOT going to be staying up late next Monday, during my fall vacation, to do this for you
  - So don't wait until the last minute...

## Project notes and erratta
- Meeting reservation updates:
  - Normally, undergrads are *not* allowed to make room reservations in Rice as there are not enough conference rooms for even the faculty who want to meet
  - However, an exception has been (and will be) made for SLP students
  - Pursuant to this, *please* follow these two rules:
    - Please only make meetings for when you are meeting with the customer or grad TA (although Jordan will make the latter ones for you)
    - Please only make meetings for the times you need, and use it for those times!
  - I am very sorry that there are not more rooms for you all to meet separately
    - That being said, if you squat in a room, the worst that will happen is that somebody will ask you to leave...
- Communication tools: there are a bunch available
  - You can create a email list at https://lists.virginia.edu
  - You can (and should!) create a [slack account](https://slack.com)
  - And others...
- Note that the intent is for *all* of the group to be present at the customer (and graduate TA) meetings
- We have now entered our "tyipcal" schedule: group meetings (in class) on Mondays, lecture or in-class workday on Wednesdays, and no class on Fridays
- If you are interested, the entire list of iteration goals is in the [iteration goals slide set](iteration-goals.html#/)
  - Keep in mind that there may be a few tweaks to future goals, but I don't expect much to change
  - I will cut-and-paste the relevant goals from that into the daily announcements, so you don't have to check that file if you don't want to

## My Todos: All Done!
- Customers have been notified that the projects have started, so you are free to email them
- There are now group accounts (and databases) on the course server; the updated account info is in PostEm
  - Keep in mind that PostEm is moving to the course administration tool...
  - You are more than welcome to change the password, if you would like
  - Or you can set up [auto-login](../../docs/dev-env-setup.html)
- The github repos are all ready, and issues and the wiki have been enabled on each
  - I did an initial commit for each
- You have access to the [uva-slp/tutorails](https://github.com/uva-slp/tutorials) repo
  - Many of these will be quite useful in getting your account and development environment set up
  - Be wary, though -- as with everything online, some may be out of date

- Again, please check in *now*; I'll wait!
- Remember: if you miss class for a *valid* reason, you can submit an attendance excuse via the course management system

	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Descriptions
- They are in a github repo: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects
  - You were all invited to join the uva-slp organization last Friday
  - Note that you have to *accept* the invitation to view the repo!
  - If you lost that invitation email, go to https://github.com/uva-slp, and follow the prompts
  - You are welcome to read the past project descriptions, but the 2016 projects are what we care about
  - They are in Markdown, HTML, and PDF; you can easily view them on github via: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects/blob/master/2016/readme.md
- A few projects have *required* platforms:
  - Python/Django: Loaves & Fishes, UVa Info Sec
  - Ruby on Rails: Innisfree
  - Unknown: McIntire Botanical Garden (should know that in a day or two)
- Two projects are *REQUIRED* to be open source:
  - Programming Contests @ UVa and Meals on Wheels
- Everybody has to LOOK OVER each and every project!
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Year Start Survey
- Everybody must complete this survey by the "end of the day" on Friday
  - If you don't, you won't get assigned to a project, and then you cannot complete this course
  - <font color='red'>JUST TO BE CLEAR: if you do not complete this survey, you will be dropped from the course!</font>
  - I will send you periodic reminders about this, so no need to panic and fill it out today, necessarily
  - It's due by the "end of the day" on Friday (which really means about 9 a.m. on Saturday morning)
- The survey prompt emails ran into "issues", so the URL for your participation is in Collab's PostEm tool
  - That URL is tagged to your userid, so we know who you are...
- The survey system has an annoying *timeout* "feature"
  - If it is idle for too long, any responses on that page that you have not submitted are lost
  - This really only happens when people keep it open, leave for lunch (or whatever), and then come back
  - It's a really stupid design, I know...
- The survey questions are on Collab in Resources/surveys/year-start, and you can veiw it from there
  - There are four pages: [1](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p1.html), [2](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p2.html), [3](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p3.html), and [4](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p4.html)
  - So if you want to ponder your responses, you can view it there first
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Optimizing the Survey Responses
- If your responses are too constrained, I won't be able to even come close to fulfilling them
- Requesting special situations
  - If you have an *entire* group that you want to work with, you have to:
    - Have *each* potential group member list all of you to work with (both in BFFs and the end comments)
    - List similar choices for projects, platforms, etc.
    - Be *very* flexible in which group (such as stating that you will work on any of them)
  - Mortal Enemies can also be people you like, but don't want to work with (I had an engaged pair list each other as mortal enemies once)
  - BFF's are *really* hard to manage, given the other constraints -- so feel free to fill it out, but don't count on it happening
    - If your BFF lists you as his/her BFF, then it has a slightly higher chance of happening
- If you state that you are not willing to work on an open source project, then you definitely will *not* be assigned to those two groups
- If you do have any connection to a given project (or framework), please not that in the comments as well

## Monday, September 12th
- The [frameworks HW](../../docs/hw-frameworks.html) is finishing up today; see [here](#/frameworkshw) for details

- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - Plasmashell crash issue: one possibility: tooltips, so try disabling them (right click taskbar -> Task Manager Settings -> General -> Uncheck "show tooltips")

- Project status: 16 docs written!

	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Project Descriptions
- They are in a github repo: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects
  - You were all invited to join the uva-slp organization last Friday
  - Note that you have to *accept* the invitation to view the repo!
  - If you lost that invitation email, go to https://github.com/uva-slp, and follow the prompts
  - You are welcome to read the past project descriptions, but the 2016 projects are what we care about
  - They are in Markdown, HTML, and PDF; you can easily view them on github via: https://github.com/uva-slp/projects/blob/master/2016/readme.md
- A few projects have *required* platforms:
  - Python/Django: Loaves & Fishes, UVa Info Sec
  - Ruby on Rails: Innisfree
  - Unknown: McIntire Botanical Garden (should know that in a day or two)
- Two projects are *REQUIRED* to be open source:
  - Programming Contests @ UVa and Meals on Wheels
- Everybody has to LOOK OVER each and every project!
- Let's go over the project descriptions...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Year Start Survey
- Everybody must complete this survey by the "end of the day" on Friday
  - If you don't, you won't get assigned to a project, and then you cannot complete this course
  - I will send you periodic reminders about this, so no need to panic and fill it out today, necessarily
- The survey prompt will be mailed to you today
  - That email is tagged to your userid, so we know who you are...
- The survey system has an annoying *timeout* "feature"
  - If it is idle for too long, any responses on that page that you have not submitted are lost
  - This really only happens when people keep it open, leave for lunch (or whatever), and then come back
  - It's a really stupid design, I know...
- The survey questions are on Collab in Resources/surveys/year-start, and you can veiw it from there
  - There are four pages: [1](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p1.html), [2](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p2.html), [3](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p3.html), and [4](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/access/content/group/cd4a69a3-3a30-4ea6-b1bc-985ae7eca8bb/surveys/year-start/year-start-p4.html)
  - So if you want to ponder your responses, you can view it there first
- Let's go over the survey...
	  </script></section>

	  <section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Optimizing the Survey Responses
- If your responses are too constrained, I won't be able to even come close to fulfilling them
- Requesting special situations
  - If you have an *entire* group that you want to work with, you have to:
    - Have *each* potential group member list all of you to work with (both in BFFs and the end comments)
    - List similar choices for projects, platforms, etc.
    - Be *very* flexible in which group (such as stating that you will work on any of them)
  - Mortal Enemies can also be people you like, but don't want to work with (I had an engaged pair list each other as mortal enemies once)
  - BFF's are *really* hard to manage, given the other constraints -- so feel free to fill it out, but don't count on it happening
    - If your BFF lists you as his/her BFF, then it has a slightly higher chance of happening
- If you state that you are not willing to work on an open source project, then you definitely will *not* be assigned to those two groups
- If you do have any connection to a given project (or framework), please not that in the comments as well

## Homework status
- The [git/github HW due](../../docs/hw-git.html) was due last Wednesday
- The [frameworks HW](../../docs/hw-frameworks.html) has three parts; the URLs **MUST** match what is listed below:
  - CakePHP, due Mon, 9/5 (end of the day): URL: http://server/~mst3k/cakephp/
    - As long as you put your code in `~/html/cakephp`, it will have that URL
  - Rails, due Fri, 9/9 (end of the day): URL: http://server/rails/mst3k
    - That URL is already configured, as long as your Rails project is in `~/railshw/`
  - Django, due Mon, 9/12 (end of the day): URL: http://server/django/mstek
    - You set this up via the `wsgi-admin` call; we recommend putting it in `~/djangohw/`
- The course server is all configured and ready to go
  - You can find your account info in the Collab Post'Em tool
  - SSH keys: 
    - RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
    - ECDSA key fingerprint is ed:1c:0e:61:94:2c:3f:53:d1:f1:dd:90:9b:f7:cb:a7
  - In theory, you should not require `sudo` to complete anything
- You have three databases that you can use (all use the same password): `mst3k`, `test_mst3k`, and `mst3k_test`
  - Use them however you would like to make the three projects work
  - If you need a fourth to make it work, let me know
- There are a few custom commands on the course server that you can use:
  - `reload-apache2`: reloads the web server
  - `view-apache2-log`: views the apache2 log
  - `wsgi-admin`: to register your Django application
- Each framework has a "getting started" page that is also updated

## Monday, August 29th
- The [first homework, on git and github](../../../../docs/hw-git.html), is out; it's due Wednesday (Aug 31) by the end of the day
  - There is also a brief [intro to git](../../../../docs/git-intro.html) as well, and everybody should at least skim through it...
  - You have to allow `aaronbloomfield` and `cjmincey` to be Collaborators on any private repos you create for this assignment, but *after* you complete the homework!
- The [frameworks HW](../../docs/hw-frameworks.html) is also ready; more on this on the next slide
- We have a VirtualBox Linux image all configured for you
  - The image is on Collab's Resources; also see the [installation
  - Make sure you specify that it's a 64-bit guest!
  - Also see the [installation instructions](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/tutorials/01-intro-unix/virtual-box.html) (from CS 2150's lab 1) and the [image details](../../docs/virtualbox-image-details.html)
- Unlike CS 2150, I don't care what system you develop on
  - But most (if not all) of the software will be on a LAMP system, so you'll have to use something similar to LAMP.  I've seen people set up Mac OS X to run MAMP, and Windows to run WAMP...
- Please fill out the github userid survey at http://goo.gl/Vjn3Yx by Wednesday of next week
  - Why don't you do that now?
  - You should have received an email about that
  - I will need that information to get your assignments graded, and to release the project information to you
- Today we will be going through [legal issues](../../slides/01-legal.html)

## Homework status
- The [git/github HW due](../../docs/hw-git.html) is due by Wednesday (end of the day)
- The [frameworks HW](../../docs/hw-frameworks.html) has three parts; the URLs **MUST** match what is listed below:
  - CakePHP, due Mon, 9/5; URL: http://server/~mst3k/cakephp/
    - As long as you put your code in `~/html/cakephp`, it will have that URL
  - Rails, due Fri, 9/9: URL: http://server/rails/mst3k
    - That URL is already configured, as long as your Rails project is in `~/railshw/`
  - Django, due Mon, 9/12: URL: http://server/django/mstek
    - You set this up via the `wsgi-admin` call; we recommend putting it in `~/djangohw/`
- The course server is all configured and ready to go
  - You can find your account info in the Collab Post'Em tool
  - SSH keys: 
    - RSA key fingerprint is 51:c6:7e:a6:44:b3:8e:f9:85:57:e0:7f:fb:c7:20:d3
    - ECDSA key fingerprint is ed:1c:0e:61:94:2c:3f:53:d1:f1:dd:90:9b:f7:cb:a7
  - In theory, you should not require `sudo` to complete anything
- You have three databases that you can use (all use the same password): `mst3k`, `test_mst3k`, and `mst3k_test`
  - Use them however you would like to make the three projects work
  - If you need a fourth to make it work, let me know
- There are a few custom commands on the course server that you can use:
  - `reload-apache2`: reloads the web server
  - `view-apache2-log`: views the apache2 log
  - `wsgi-admin`: to register your Django application
- Each framework has a "getting started" page that is also updated
