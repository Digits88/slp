<p><a href="index.html">Go up to the main SLP documents page</a> (<a href="index.md">md</a>)</p>
<p>In class, we mentioned what you should keep track of during every iteration. Because eveyone does things differently, you should create a checklist that includes all (1) the tasks you should do and (2) forms/reports/surveys you should submit in any given iteration.</p>
<p>You have until the end of Friday 9/29 (11:59pm) to complete your &quot;iteration checklist&quot; and submit it through Collab.</p>
