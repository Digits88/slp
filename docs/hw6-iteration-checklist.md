SLP: HW6 - Iteration Checklist (5 points)
=======================

[Go up to the main SLP documents page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

In class, we mentioned what you should keep track of during every iteration. Because eveyone does things differently, you should create a checklist that includes all (1) the tasks you should do or (2) forms/reports/surveys you should submit in any given iteration.

You have until the end of Friday 9/29 (11:59pm) to complete your "iteration checklist" and submit it through Collab.
